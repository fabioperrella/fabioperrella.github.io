# How we boosted response time of a service 2.5x using a simple singleton

This is a story of a hard debugging process and an easy solution for a problem that we were facing at WeTransfer.

A few weeks ago, we started rolling out to production our new storage manager, Storm.

As we increased the rollout percentage, we noticed a problem that was affecting its performance.

Storm is written in Ruby and uses AWS gems to interact with S3 and SQS.

It's worth saying that I'm an experienced Ruby engineer but not so familiar with the AWS ecosystem.

## The problem

The problem started when we noticed on Appsginal, some HTTP requests to the AWS metadata endpoint taking so long to complete:

![image1](../debug-aws-assets/image1.png)

This endpoint always runs in this specific IP (169.254.169.254) because it runs on an internal AWS container.

If I had seen this issue alone, I would have taken much more time to understand which dependency makes these requests because
as we can see, Appsignal does not show the origin of the request. By the way, we told them that this feature would help us!

Thanks to the engineers who have experience with AWS at WeTransfer, I saved some time with that, and I discovered that the AWS gem uses this endpoint to get credentials to interact with AWS services.

There are more details about how it works on the [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html).

So, when I started to work on this issue, my first goal was to understand how the AWS gem managed credentials and when it
made these requests.

## Understanding how the AWS gem works

Storm has many AWS gems on its `Gemfile.lock`. I wanted to find out where these requests were made.

I started using a simple `grep` command in the staging console as follows:

```
~/storm $ bundle info aws-sdk-core
  * aws-sdk-core (3.114.0)
  Path: /usr/local/bundle/gems/aws-sdk-core-3.114.0

~/storm $ grep -r 169.254.169.254 /usr/local/bundle/gems/
/usr/local/bundle/gems/aws-sdk-core-3.114.0/lib/aws-sdk-core/instance_profile_credentials.rb:    # @option options [String] :ip_address ('169.254.169.254')
/usr/local/bundle/gems/aws-sdk-core-3.114.0/lib/aws-sdk-core/instance_profile_credentials.rb:      @ip_address = options[:ip_address] || '169.254.169.254'
/usr/local/bundle/gems/aws-sdk-core-3.114.0/lib/aws-sdk-core/ec2_metadata.rb:    # @option options [String] :endpoint (169.254.169.254) The IMDS endpoint.
/usr/local/bundle/gems/aws-sdk-core-3.114.0/lib/aws-sdk-core/ec2_metadata.rb:      @endpoint = options[:endpoint] || '169.254.169.254'
```

Note: I ran this grep command in staging because there are only Storm dependencies (gems) installed in this container. If I had grepped it on my laptop, it would have searched in gems that I use in other projects too.

So, I found a file to start the investigation: `aws-sdk-core/instance_profile_credentials.rb`.

First, I tried to add a `raise '----here----'` in the method [open_connection](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/5e9d68f8c9dd59ebd43585ece8cd01e0a4c90b79/gems/aws-sdk-core/lib/aws-sdk-core/instance_profile_credentials.rb#L155) that makes the HTTP request:

```ruby
def open_connection
  raise '----here----'
  http = Net::HTTP.new(@ip_address, @port, nil)
  #...
```

Then, I ran the test suite to see if any test was calling this method but none were using it.

I used the option `--fail-fast` when running RSpec tests to abort the execution in the first failure.

Note1: To change the gem code, I opened it in my text editor with the command `bundle open aws-sdk-core`.

Note2: I recommend running [bundle pristine](https://bundler.io/v1.15/man/bundle-pristine.1.html) after modifying gems code to restore their original files.

After that, there were 2 possibilities:
- no tests were covering this path
- the class `InstanceProfileCredentials` is maybe used only in the production environment

Then, I started to search where this class was referenced inside the `aws-sdk-core` gem and I found it in the file [lib/aws-sdk-core/credential_provider_chain.rb](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/7c730a81508981ec379920e04af60776fef69386/gems/aws-sdk-core/lib/aws-sdk-core/credential_provider_chain.rb#L166):

```ruby
def instance_profile_credentials(options)
  if ENV['AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI']
    ECSCredentials.new(options)
  else
    InstanceProfileCredentials.new(options)   # <------ here
  end
end
```

So, I added a `raise` and ran the tests again, but nothing.

```ruby
def instance_profile_credentials(options)
  raise 'aaaaaaaaaaa'
  if ENV['AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI']
    ECSCredentials.new(options)
  else
    InstanceProfileCredentials.new(options)   # <------ here
  end
end
```

So, I continued going up in the stack trace, trying to find a point where I could start debugging on my laptop.

Luckily, I found a point in the next interaction, in the method [providers](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/7c730a81508981ec379920e04af60776fef69386/gems/aws-sdk-core/lib/aws-sdk-core/credential_provider_chain.rb#L21):

```ruby
def providers
  raise 'aaaaaaaaaaa'
  [
    [:static_credentials, {}],
    [:static_profile_assume_role_web_identity_credentials, {}],
    [:static_profile_sso_credentials, {}],
    #...
    [:instance_profile_credentials, {
      retries: @config ? @config.instance_profile_credentials_retries : 0,
      http_open_timeout: @config ? @config.instance_profile_credentials_timeout : 1,
      http_read_timeout: @config ? @config.instance_profile_credentials_timeout : 1
    }]
  ]
end
```

At this point, it was possible to add a breakpoint (`binding.pry`), run the test that has failed, and debug it.

I'm a fan of the [pry-byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug) gem beucase it's possible to use commands such as `up`, `down`, `step`, `next` and `finish`. So, I used it.

After adding the breakpoint, I ran the failing test and used the command `up` to navigate in the stack trace to find which method was calling the method `providers`, so I found the method [resolve](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/5e9d68f8c9dd59ebd43585ece8cd01e0a4c90b79/gems/aws-sdk-core/lib/aws-sdk-core/credential_provider_chain.rb#L11).

```ruby
def resolve
  providers.each do |method_name, options|
    provider = send(method_name, options.merge(config: @config))
    return provider if provider && provider.set?
  end
  nil
end
```

Using the `up` command is **much easier** than trying to find a method reference with text search.

So, I could understand that the method `resolve` tries to find which credential provider is configured for the current environment, and for the `test` environment, it was using the `AssumeRoleCredentials` one.

This provider is used when we set AWS environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`.
