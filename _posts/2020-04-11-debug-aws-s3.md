# How we boosted response time of a service 2.5x using a simple singleton

This is a story of a hard debugging process and an easy solution for a problem that we were facing at WeTransfer.

In the last few weeks, we started rolling out to production our new storage manager, Storm, and when we started to increase the throughput, we noticed a problem that was affecting its performance, but we were not sure how much.

This service is written in Ruby and it uses the `aws-sdk` gem to interact with AWS S3 and SQS.

It's worth saying that I'm an experienced Ruby engineer but not so familiar with the AWS ecosystem.

## The problem

The problem started with us, asking help to the Platform team to figure out why some requests to the AWS metadata
end point took so much time.

This endpoint always run on a specific IP, 169.254.169.254.

If I had seen this issue alone, I would have taken much more time to understand which part of the code does that because
as we can see, Appsignal gives no clue about the origin of the request (we asked them this feature).

Thanks to the engineers that are experienced with AWS, I saved some time with that.

Our services use this endpoint to get credentials. There are more details about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html).

So, when I started to work on this issue, my first goal was to understand how the AWS gem manages credentials and when it
does these requests.
